        <h3>Soft Spot</h3>
        <h5>by keshi</h5>

        <p>
        <em>[Verse 1]</em><br>
        I don't go out, but I’ll do it for you<br>
        You never liked it when I drink too much<br>
        I hate to dance, but I'll dance with you<br>
        'Cause I’d do anything to feel your touch<br>
        </p>

        <p>
        <em>[Pre-Chorus]</em><br>
        Don't like anybody, tell me why it's different with you<br>
        Don't believe in love, but no one makes me feel like you do<br>
        I don't say it much, 'cause I just always thought that you knew, ahh<br>
        </p>
    
        <p>
        <em>[Chorus]</em><br>
        It's what you do to me<br>
        I'm wrapped around your finger and I can’t stop<br>
        You know I got a soft spot for you<br>
        You know I got a soft spot for you<br>
        Baby, can’t you see?<br>
        I need you, 'cause you’re everything that I'm not<br>
        You know I got a soft spot for you<br>
        You know I got a soft spot for you<br>
        </p>

        <p>
        <em>[Verse 2]</em><br>
        Too late<br>
        Don't wanna fall, baby, I just<br>
        Don't need somebody else to throw me aside<br>
        But I’m up all night<br>
        Thinkin' 'bout how it can be you to change my heart, but I<br>
        </p>

        <p>
        <em>[Pre-Chorus]</em><br>
        Don't like anybody, tell me why it's different with you<br>
        Don't believe in love, but no one makes me feel like you do<br>
        I don't say it much, 'cause I just always thought that you knew, ahh<br>
        </p>

        <p>
        <em>[Chorus]</em><br>
        It's what you do to me<br>
        I'm wrapped around your finger and I can't stop<br>
        You know I got a soft spot for you<br>
        You know I got a soft spot for you<br>
        Baby, can't you see?<br>
        I need you, 'cause you're everything that I'm not<br>
        You know I got a soft spot for you<br>
        You know I got a soft spot for you<br>
        </p>

        <p>
        <em>[Bridge]</em><br>
        For you<br>
        For you<br>
        For you<br>
        You know I got a soft spot for you<br>
        </p>   

        <p>
        <em>[Outro]</em><br>
        It's what you do to me<br>
        I'm wrapped around your finger and I can't stop<br>
        You know I got a soft spot for you<br>
        You know I got a soft spot for you<br>
        </p>
